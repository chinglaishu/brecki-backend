Authorization

1. User Item Authorization 

Check if the item requesting is belong to correct user by adding user id 
to the filter.

For example, request a user item by id, the filter will become 

{
  _id: id, 
  userId: request user id 
}

Therefore, if user do not own this item can not get this user item,
admin user can bypass this, user id will not add to the filter. 

2. Field Access (not implement here)

Should limit able to access field, by adding limit to the DTO part,
to avoid user directly update password.

Type

Should not be any type, especially in base controller and base service,
fixed in the new template

Error Message

Error Message should be in code, and match in Frontend by Language instead
of detect language in Backend. Fixed in new template
